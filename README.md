# FGO Wiki Parser
A python script used to transform quest .json files from the (Atlas Academy Database)[https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/] into wiki markup for the (Fate/Grand Order Wiki)[https://fategrandorder.fandom.com], with some edits required by the user to format to wiki standards.

To use, place the .JSON files you want parsed inside an "inputs" directory, and then run in the command line:

```python reader.py```
